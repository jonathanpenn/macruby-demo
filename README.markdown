Set of demonstration code for my Raleigh CocoaConf 2011 talk.

`location.rb` is a simple command line app that polls for the current location
and prints it to standard out using the Core Location framework.

`gui_location.rb` is a gui version that builds a window containing a statically
generated map image from Google maps of your current location in a WebView.

`LocationLocationLocation` is a full Xcode project that does the same thing as
`gui_location.rb`.
